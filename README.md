# MongoDB
Need to install MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.
After downloading unzip the files into your users folder under your username and rename the folder to "mongodb".
Create a "mongodb-data" folder in the same users folder such that "mongodb" and "mongodb-data" are next to each other in the folder structure.
After run the following command in terminal: /Users/{USERNAME}/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/{USERNAME}/mongodb-data
Replace {USERNAME} with your username. This will enable the database

# Running with nodemon
Use npm install to install packages
Make sure nodemon is installed, then run npm run dev

# Note
.env should not be included. It will need to be gained elsewhere
