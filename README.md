Need to install MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.<br/>
After downloading unzip the files into your users folder under your username and rename the folder to "mongodb".<br/>
Create a "mongodb-data" folder in the same users folder such that "mongodb" and "mongodb-data" are next to each other in the folder structure.<br/>
After run the following command in terminal: /Users/{USERNAME}/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/{USERNAME}/mongodb-data<br/>
Replace {USERNAME} with your username. This will enable the database<br/>
